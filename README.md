# itunesstats

Takes the exported iTunes library (Library.xml) file and aggregates statistics. Prints a sorted list of most played artist (by total playtime) and their most played song both by playcount and total play time.

**Disclaimers**
* This may not work with all versions of iTunes. If the structure of Library.xml has been modified over versions then this program may fail
* Requires the iTunes Library file to be named "Library.xml" and for it to be in the same directory as where this python file is run.
